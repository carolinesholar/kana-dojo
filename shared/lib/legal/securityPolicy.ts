# Security Policy

**Effective Date:** 04/03/2025 (March 4th, 2025)

At **KanaDojo**, we take security seriously and strive to protect our website and users from potential threats. Although our website does not collect personal user data directly, we implement security measures to safeguard our platform.


## 1. Scope

This Security Policy applies to the **KanaDojo** website (kanadojo.com), including its infrastructure, content, and third-party services used (such as Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, and PostHog).


## 2. Website Security Practices

To ensure the security of our website, we:

- Use **HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption)** to protect data transmitted between the website and users.
- Regularly update our **software, dependencies, and third-party services** to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- Monitor for unauthorized access, potential threats, and security issues.
- Restrict administrative access to trusted personnel only.


## 3. Data Security & Privacy

We do not collect personal data directly. However, we use the following analytics services that gather anonymous usage information:

- **Google Analytics** - gathers page visits, browser type, and geographic location
- **Microsoft Clarity** - collects session recordings, heatmaps, and user interaction data
- **PostHog** - collects feature usage analytics and session replays

To enhance data security:

- We **do not store sensitive or personally identifiable information**.
- Google Analytics data is handled under [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- Microsoft Clarity data is handled under [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).
- PostHog data is handled under [PostHog's Privacy Policy](https://posthog.com/privacy).
- We allow users to **opt out of analytics tracking** using browser settings, privacy extensions, or the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).


## 4. Handling Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability on our website, we encourage responsible disclosure:

### 📩 How to Report a Security Issue

We appreciate **ethical hacking and responsible disclosure** and will investigate reported vulnerabilities promptly.


## 5. Third-Party Services & Dependencies

We utilize the following third-party services that have their **own security policies**:
